# SpatialOCT-Glaucoma

This repository contains the implementation of the paper entitled "Spatial-aware Transformer-GRU Framework for Enhanced Glaucoma Diagnosis from 3D OCT Imaging." Our work introduces an innovative approach combining Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models to improve the diagnosis of glaucoma from 3D OCT imaging data.
